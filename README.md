# Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning modeling and deployment
This repository builds a machine learning model on Titanic dataset, and creates a web app to predict the survival rate of passengers by using the model.
 
## Prerequisites
- Datasets  
You will find the datasets here. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)  
- Dependencies  
xgboost==0.90  
Flask==1.1.1  
dill==0.3.0  
numpy==1.16.4  
requests==2.22.0  
pandas==0.25.1  
scikit_learn==0.21.3  

## Accomplishment  
- EDA  
- Feature Engineering with a custom estimator  
- Modeling  
  - Test and build a final model which would be used in the deployment  
- Delpoyment on Heroku  
  - Run the app locally using Flask  
  - Then deploy the app to Heroku
